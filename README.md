A web application that generates images from text prompts using a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and styled with Tailwind CSS.

The project includes:

Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS) – responsive and intuitive UI for entering prompts and viewing generated images.

Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) – handles prompt requests, stores generated images, and manages user sessions.

Image Generation – integrates AI models to convert text descriptions into images in real-time.

User Experience – smooth interactions, prompt history, and easy-to-use interface for both desktop and mobile.
